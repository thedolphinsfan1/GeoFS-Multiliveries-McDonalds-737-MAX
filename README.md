# GeoFS-Multiliveries-McDonalds-737-MAX
Want a McDonald's livery for your 737 MAX but you don't want to join the Discord server or do it yourself? I have the thing for you. Based off of the original actual McDonald's plane, I have created this livery and am willing to share it with you.
 
 The livery is based off this plane:

 And here is the base map:

This livery is owned and was created by Pawser Aviation. Do not modify or use without giving me credit.
